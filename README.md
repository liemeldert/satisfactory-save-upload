# Quicksave

/--- ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§ ---\

## Simple management of save files
 - detects when game opens and attempts to sync if the remote file is newer
 - game launch forwarder for when the saves must be synced before the game starts loading, esp on steam deck.
 - supports file upload to a network share, and more later on.
 - detects when game is closed and uploads the save file to a remote location
